## Overview
Camßen's Colour Pack Version 4.0 is a new, massively overhauled edition of the classic parts mod that may well be one of the most used parts mods available at the moment. This new version features a sleeker categorisation system using Subcategories to minimise cluttering and includes newly-added Advanced Colour versions of the three existing parts, an optional stacking component to enable nigh-unlimited placement of the parts onto any other part including eachother, and perhaps one of the most requested improvements to the mod: the ability to preview the colour of a part in the Build Mode of the Editor without needing to switch to Paint Mode.

The mod has been tested thoroughly and is backwards-compatible with the immediately previous version, 3.1, meaning that any creations made with the that specific version of the CBCP will be loadable and editable with this newest version installed. The worst that can be expected is a few positioning abnormalities owing to the change from version 3 to version 3.1, which added a Nudge (Depth) Handle to the parts, but other relevant shape changes should remain the same.

The mod no longer requires a Force Save mod or any disabling validation checks in order to save or load creations with these new parts, whether they were made with this version or 3.1. It is advised, however, to tag creations made with these parts with "gaprop" lest they randomly appear in your game and therefor cause issues if the mod is removed or something else goes wrong. LilyValley's CBCP Addon horn part is still compatible with this mod, but will appear in a separate category closer to the core game categories.

The source file for the mod is absolutely massive, compressed down into a smaller ".sporemod" type file, necessitating the use of the Spore ModAPI Easy Installer (available as part of the ModAPI Launcher Kit, located here: http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55 ... PI/Public/) to accommodate the sheer number of models required to properly allow for previewing, as a better solution is currently not available for that. The average download time is still relatively short and installation doesn't take long at all, despite the size. The ".sporemod" format also permits the Stacking options of the parts to be changed before starting or after closing the game (never during runtime) via the Options Gear available in the mod list provided by the ModAPI Easy Uninstaller, similar to Dark Injection and Project: Replicant.

This mod update was created with the permission of and will continue to be distributed under the name of the original creator Camßen (also known as Camben), seeing as the name is more recognisable, there are not enough significant differences to justify rebranding, and as a show of appreciation to one of the originators of custom part creation.


## Addons
The changes made to the mod allow for easier development of addons where time permits. Due to the limited space a Category can contain before becoming stuffed on smaller resolutions, this means that only a handful of addons can be active at any one time. Disabling an addon in the mod's Installer will prevent it from appearing in the Palette, but will not remove the parts thereby breaking creations made with them.

### Current Addons:
Keratinhorns (added v4.3.0)
The simple Keratinhorn weapons, but with an enhanced model with increased morphability and a nudge handle.
More to come
